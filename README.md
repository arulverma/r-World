# r/World

Have you heard about r/place? <br>
It's a social experiment ran in 2017 and 2021 where redditors were allowed to change a single pixel on a 16 million pixel canvas every 2-20 minutes. <br>

We were interested in replicating this experiment using the blockchain to make each pixel an NFT that you can buy and sell to see how the monetization of pixel editing changes the dynamic of people's actions. <br> To ensure that no one could monopolize pixels and change them all themselves, we made it so an account can only change a single pixel in its lifetime.
